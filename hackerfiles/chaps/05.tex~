\emph{Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!}*rail gun firing sound

(Rail gun) A large weapon shots across the Halo image displayed on his tablet destroying battle ships with only a handful of fires. The weapon was nearly as large as the ZenKZ controlling it. Single barreled, with dozens of rings blazing colors of red, orange and yellow after each fire. 

\emph{Whoosh!}* explosion sound

Haruto had never had so much excitement with reading history notes. 

The battle before him pause with battleship in split in half and melted metal everywhere. A picture of a middle-aged woman overlayed the dying ships. Something Haruto was still getting used too. 

\textbf{\texttt{My name is Captain Shihou Lin and I am the creator of the original rail gun.}} The woman began. She moved to continued to speak, but frozen in place as Aeliana's voice cut in. 

\emph{`Ah, just when it was getting good. Aeliana has the worst timing.'} Haruto thought with mild disappointment.

\textbf{\texttt{Before going into the details of the rail gun, it is important to understand the history surrounding...}} Her voice droned on, and on, and \emph{on}.

A sharp pain jolted him awake. Blinking around, Aeliana's voice was still in the background talking about famine or something like that.

\emph{`I haven't missed anything.'} He complained.

\textbf{\sffamily{You will if you don't focus, kid. \emph{Focus}.}} QB9 growled out.

\emph{`Yeah, yeah.'} Haruto thought back as he tried to focus on the extra material. He'd talked with Aeliana enough to know that her lecture voice, a bland monotone, could cure insomnia. Another jolt forced him to pay a little more attention. Another thing he was learning was that Aeliana was unnecessarily thorough about \emph{everything}.

Haruto wasn't sure how much time had passed as Aeliana continued to talk, while Haruto stared at the frozen face of the amazing Captain Shihou. What he did know was that QB9 had jolted him awake some six, \emph{zip}, seven times now.

With a scowl, Haruto disconnected his BISM from the tablet immediate stopping Aeliana's boring lecture voice. He aught to be thankful, really considering he could still be going over pointless trade agreements and Kanopos Clan history if he'd been using the Princess' notes. But all he wanted was to listen to the original lecture notes without an additional ten hours of \emph{extras}.

\textbf{\sffamily{Don't be so dramatic, kid. It's more like 4 to 1.}} QB9 corrected.

\emph{`Like that makes it any better?'} Haruto replied leaning back in his seat. 

Aeliana huffed in annoyance at the action. ``You can't just give \emph{up}!'' She whispered fiercely. ``We've just barely started.''

``I'm not giving up!'' Haruto replied without bothering with the fake whisper. He hated it when anyone accused him of throwing in his chips. He was just taking a break. \emph{`Yeah, just a long break.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{For the rest of the day, brat?}} QB9 questioned. \textbf{\sffamily{That's not called a break.}}

\emph{`I'll get on it tomorrow, which is more than I used to do. So, a \emph{break}.'} Nodding to himself he caught Aeliana's rolling her eyes.

A loud cough caused Haruto to look up as the old hag at the front desk stared down her nose at him. ``Volume!'' She snapped in a severe whisper.

``\emph{Volume}.'' Haruto mimicked her under his breath as she turned back to her work. \emph{`What does she have, ear enhancements or something?'} He didn't care what QB9 said, she was out to get him, personally.

``And you can't throw a fit, just because it's a little harder than you like.'' Aeliana continued as if the old woman wasn't discriminating against him.

``I am not throwing a \emph{fit}.'' He responded arms crossed defensively. 

QB9 snorted in amusement. \textbf{\sffamily{The girl has a point, kid. If you could just focus. You could get through this section on rail guns. It's interesting enough to keep even your attention.}}

\emph{`I'm going to pretend like that wasn't an insult.'} Haruto replied.

\textbf{\sffamily{I'm just saying it how I see it.}} QB9 commented neutrally. \textbf{\sffamily{Even the Princess seems to agree with me in that last correspondence.}}

Haruto let a frown touch his lips. \emph{`One, I told you to stop adding sections to my letters. And two, she didn't say she agreed. Just that my attention span can some times be short. SOMETIMES.'} Haruto corrected.

\textbf{\sffamily{Sorry, to burst your bubble, kid. But she was just being polite.}} QB9 added.

Throwing his hands in the air, Haruto let out a frustrated sigh. \emph{`You're all out to get me!'} 

``You done throwing a fit, now?'' Aeliana questioned bluntly. Haruto flushed in response. ``You have got to tell me who you're talking to all this time.'' She continued as her eyes scanned her own tablet. ``It can't be the K\={o}taishi, she off ship.'' She added under her breath, but loud enough for Haruto's sharp ears to pick it up.

Ignoring the question having no intention of introducing QB9 to another of his friends. Instead, he asked one of his own. ``Why do I even need to know any of this?'' It was low enough that the old hag only gave him a harsh look. In his head he continued to QB9, \emph{`I'm doing significantly better. Even you have to admit that.'} Who knew showing up for exams could exponentially improve his scores?

\textbf{\sffamily{You're still underachieving.}} QB9 replied easily.

At the same time, Aeliana sighed in her reply. ``I don't know how many times I have to say this, but each lesson builds on the last. You can't just learn the new stuff without context.''

\emph{`Context, context, context.'} Haruto thought bitterly.

\textbf{\sffamily{And if you don't get better with that \emph{context}, I'm taking care of it.}} QB9 warned.

Haruto chose to ignore him, ``Can't we move on to something else?'' Haruto tried to change the topic having already asked if Aeliana had non-annotated notes he could listen to, which she didn't. If anything, he might at least get a working break. ``Like that relic stuff, you're working on for your Showcase. Are you getting anywhere with that?''

Disconnecting from her own tablet, Aeliana gave another long sigh. They'd studied long enough together over the past six months for her to know he was pretty much done for the day. Honestly, he didn't know \emph{how} she did this for hours on end. Thirty minutes was exhausting for him, and they'd been at it for more than an hour now.

\textbf{\sffamily{Barely 75 minutes, kid. Normal people can do that just fine.}} QB9 added.

\emph{`Normal? Normal is over-rated.'} Haruto replied.

\textbf{\sffamily{Not this kind of normal.}} QB9 countered. \textbf{\sffamily{There's got to be medicine to fix your attention span...}} QB9 added softly. Haruto wasn't worried though. Without a body, QB9 could do very little on his own. And the Princess was unlikely to help either. A smug feeling filtered through him causing Haruto to frown.

\emph{`On second thought, maybe I should start check my MINOS.'} He thought. The last thing he needed was unnecessary meds slowing his mind down.

``Nothing yet, as you very well know I'm waiting for my dad to return with one, which should be any day now.'' Aeliana replied interrupting his thoughts. Haruto pushed her spare tablet back to her so she could pack that too. 

\emph{`And who needs a backup, anyway?'} He thought. ``Overachiever.'' He muttered under his breath.

``At least I'm achieving \emph{something}.'' Aeliana replied without looking up. ``Did you bring those parts we talked about?''

Haruto winched at the comment as he hastily looked around, the old woman seemed to be annoying someone else for the moment so they were fine. This time, at least. \emph{`For a Guild member, she sure is sloppy.'} Haruto thought.

\textbf{\sffamily{If she's asking you to get those parts, I hardly think she's Guild proper.}} QB9 commented.

Haruto shook his head in confusion, but turned his attention back to Aeliana. ``What have I told you about talking about this stuff \emph{here}?'' He replied in a harsh whisper.

``Do you have it or not?'' She questioned impatiences leaking into her voice.

``What you got a hot date or something?'' Haruto countered. Aeliana just kept staring at him. With a large sigh, he looked to make sure no one was looking in their direction, before pulling out a spare electronics pouch from his SKIM. Aeliana was nice and all, but times like these really showed her lack of self-preservation. Of course, the likelihood any Keeper would arrest \emph{her} was laughable. \emph{`About as likely as the Princess getting searched, I guess.'} Haruto thought as he handed it over.

``Sorry, it's been a stressful week.'' She replied as she took the pouch, placing it immediately in her kit with the rest of her things.

``Sure.'' Haruto shrugged at the omission. 

\textbf{\sffamily{Trouble in paradise?}} QB9 commented.

\emph{`Probably.'} Haruto thought. Aeliana's relationship with the Amur heir was more often than not contentious. But, more importantly, an unwelcome topic of conversation. Instead, he focused on the slightly more concerning request. ``Why'd you even need that stuff anyway?'' The question seemed to pull the Aeliana out of her own thoughts.

``Huh?'' She replied clearly only half listening.

Gesturing wildly to her kit, he continued in as low a voice as he could manage. ``You know triggers like these only work for...'' Looking around he attempted to lower his voice further, ``\emph{blasters}.'' \emph{`Which everyone knows is completely illegal to own. So what could she possible want with them.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Obviously, she's planning to kill someone.}} QB9 answered easily. \textbf{\sffamily{Or I suppose protect herself.}} He added reluctantly.

Haruto tried not to look worried. He made his home in the Lower Level, and he knew for a fact that the Guild Princess didn't need protection. Messing with the Helian family was a death wish. At least physically. The Princess mentioned trade agreements every once in a while that didn't sound favorable to the Guild masters.

``Thanks for getting this stuff.'' Was her only reply. 

Haruto held back a sigh. He'd asked the same thing to her when she'd asked for them with no response. He'd been tempted to tell her no. Sure he'd done felony worthy stuff in the past.

\textbf{\sffamily{Daily if we count the GH network.}} QB9 added helpfully.

\emph{`Okay, so I do felony worth stuff all the time, but even I don't normally travel that section of Blue Sector in LL.'} Haruto shivered at the memory. Bad stuff happened there all the time. And the Gods knew that an orphan like him going missing, probably wouldn't have kicked up much of a fuss.

\textbf{\sffamily{If we told her how much work it was, we could get a nice favor out of it.}} QB9 suggested.

\emph{`No. It isn't worth mentioning the trouble...'}

QB9 interrupted him, \textbf{\sffamily{\emph{Danger}.}}

Haruto rolled his eyes at the correction, \emph{`I'm not going to mess with a good thing.'} He continued. \emph{`And QB, this is a really good thing.'} Feeling QB9's resignation let Haruto relax a little.

\emph{`This is a good thing.'} He repeated to himself. Aeliana wasn't just letting him use her spare tablet - an XP3 model that was like a million times better than anything the Academy had or he could hope to afford - she had also given him her backup notes. Notes that went as far back as their first days at KANP. Of course she didn't trust him to not break her tablet, but baby steps. \emph{`And her notes are really thorough, even if they are boring.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Not that you've read all of them.}} QB9 replied.

\emph{`You try sitting through an hour of Aeliana drone on and on about famine or another.'} Haruto shot back.

\textbf{\sffamily{I did. All of it.}} QB9 replied cockily.

\emph{`Well, then I've got nothing to worry about then.'} Haruto thought back, but he knew what QB9 was getting at. Ever since their new Lieutenants had arrived, things had been different. And he just wasn't sure if that was a good or bad thing. Lieutenant Sang-eo had installed a very impressive jammer that he turned on to the highest possible setting even on the small quizzes.

\emph{`I mean, military grade jamming systems are just overkill.'} He thought, but QB9's appreciation was palatable, which caused Haruto to grudgingly admit he shared it. That and it seemed like the guy knew Lower Level like the back of his hand. Lieutenant Sang-eo had found all of his class ditching hiding places within the first week. How was a guy supposed to relax under those conditions?

\textbf{\sffamily{You should be in class anyway.}} QB9 replied without sympathy.

Haruto wasn't sure he agreed, but it hardly mattered. The point, which had gotten lost somewhere, was that with that stupid jammer, he couldn't communicate well with QB9. And while they were working on a solution, even Haruto had to admit it could take him months, maybe even a full year, to come up with a work-around. Military jammers like that being just old school enough that hacking physically was out of the question.

\textbf{\sffamily{At least that other kid's symbiote can't just sit on his shoulder anymore.}} QB9 commented. 

\emph{`Seo-Jun's test scores aren't going to help me.'} Haruto replied hotly only for QB9 to seemingly shrug his rage off.

``Hey, hey, \emph{hey}!'' Came an insistent whisper. Blinking up he was surprised to see Aeliana standing next to him. ``I've been trying to get your attention for like five minutes.'' Her hands on her hip as she stared him down.

``Uh, sorry?'' Haruto replied as he also stood to leave.

``Honestly, I don't know why I put up with you.'' She replied as they made their way out of KOAL. ``I don't suppose you'll tell me who you were talking too this time?'' She continued just as softly.

``Just thinking about the new Lieutenants.'' Which was technically correct, not that he was completely sure how he felt about Lieutenant Y\'{u}.

``Well, I for one like them. Lieutenant Sang-eo treats everyone the same regardless of Clan status.'' She continued in her uppity voice. Haruto was learning to just ignore it.

``And Y\'{u}?''

``\emph{Lieutenant} Y\'{u}.'' She flashed his a disapproving look, which he also ignored. If he took every disapproving look seriously, he'd probably have zero self-esteem. ``Anyway,'' she continued, ``I'm not sure about him yet.''

\emph{`Probably because he likes to brown nose you too,'} he thought. But aloud he said, ``Well, I can't complain too much. Neither has kicked me out of class yet, so improvement all around.'' He replied in full voice earning a harsh shush from the front desk.

Aeliana gave him a withering look, before sending an apologetic smile at the old hag. Haruto could really care less.

At the door to the library, Aeliana turned to him. ``Hey, you want to get lunch. I know this great place just down the street.''

QB9 suppressed a rising swell of hunger. ``Nah, I'm good.'' He replied. Aeliana's tastes ran a little on the expensive side. And when he said a little he really meant a \emph{lot}. As there was one shop he could afford in Solas, and it wasn't anywhere near the plaza. ``Besides, I figured you'd want to eat with Amur.''

``No, she's busy.'' The disappointed look on her face made him almost regret the decision. ``Clan stuff.'' She added her eyes looking far into the distance before returning to him. A large fake smile in place. ``Well another time, then.'' She turned immediately and started down toward the center of Solas.

Haruto wasn't sure if she was going to go to the food place or to her home. Either way, there was nothing for him in that direction. Taking a back alley, he ran up to the rooftop.

\textbf{\sffamily{You should just tell her we can't afford those places.}} QB9 replied.

\emph{`Yeah, but it's kinda embarrassing.'} Haruto replied as he began an aimless walk along the rooftops. His thoughts drifted to what he could afford to eat. His own food supplies running dangerously low, he knew he'd have to prepare for a food run sooner rather than later.  

\textbf{\sffamily{And some more seeds.}} QB9 added. \textbf{\sffamily{Fresh vegetables will make my job easier.}}

Haruto ignored him, his garden still had several hybrid tomatoes on the vine. Not to mention he didn't really have a place to put more potted plants. But it was more than that as the smells of street vendors assaulted his sensitive nose. Real fancy food just sounded better than tomatoes that were probably nothing like the original fruit that bore their name. And wouldn't it be nice to enjoy something he didn't have to cook?

\emph{`I really should just tell her.'} Haruto thought. To enjoy the company of someone who could appreciate the subtle flavors of a good meal. It was times like this when the thought of his empty apartment was more than a little depressing. With the Princess off ship, life on Kanopos was just a little duller.

\textbf{\sffamily{She'll be back any day now, kid.}} QB9 interrupted his thoughts.

\emph{`It's still been months!'} Haruto complained. \emph{`I guys allowed to be upset about that. I mean how long does it take to tour the Empire?'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Properly?}} QB9 commented as a galactic map appeared in Haruto's vision causing him to miss a step. \textbf{\sffamily{About 27 months, so you aught to be glad she's mostly just visiting Jade Empire nobles.}} QB9 replied.

\emph{`It's still not fair.'} Haruto replied an anger pout on his face.

\textbf{\sffamily{Neither is begin stuck with an overgrown child all day, but I manage.}} QB9 countered.

Plopping down on a nearby rooftop, he wasn't surprised to found himself in Prayer Alley. This part of the ship always seemed to bring peace to his racing thoughts. The sounds of the humming ship replaced by birds and four legged animals from the nearby park. A safe haven to both him and the animals it housed.

\emph{`And maybe I'll see her today.'} Haruto thought as he stared down at the quite streets below. 

\textbf{\sffamily{Kid, she promised to message us when she returned.}} QB9 replied quietly.

\emph{`Yeah, sure.'} Haruto replied listlessly. The Princess would get to him when she could. But experience told him that could be days after her return. Tatsuki, her faithful retainer, was known to guard her every step for days after her return to Kanopos. And if there was one person, the Princess had yet to get away with messaging him while in their presences, it was Tatsuki. 

\textbf{\sffamily{A few days won't kill us.}} QB9 commented.

Haruto didn't dignify it with a response. Instead, he looked out over the northern section of Sanctuary Park and surrounding quiet streets within Prayer Alley. At this time of day, few people were out and about. And of those that were, the majority held the quiet bearings of the Gento Clan. But not \emph{his} Gento. 

Disappointed, Haruto forced his eyes away from every shadowy figure to the elegant path of a bird in flight. It's feathers were vividly colored and it's beak longer than normal. \emph{`Must be a new breed.'} He thought as he watched it play with the other birds in the Park.

He wasn't sure how much time passed before QB9 broke the silence. \textbf{\sffamily{Hey kid.}} He began. \textbf{\sffamily{Why don't we go to that MINOS stand for lunch? Treat yourself today.}}

\emph{`Yeah, sure. Why not?'} Haruto thought as he stood up brushing off imaginary dust. There was always a chance that tomorrow would be the day. The Princess would eventually have to come home.

Movement out of the corner of his eyes of long flowing hair catch his attention. ``No, it can't be?'' He said aloud, racing swiftly in the direction of familiar formal coveralls. Only one person in the Gento Clan was allowed to wear both white and black, and she was his best friend.

A smile broke out as he walked quietly above along the rooftops. \emph{`See, I told you I'd find her.'} Haruto didn't wait for a response before sending her a welcome home message.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    GhostHacker: Welcome home Princess!\\
    GhostHacker: For a second there, I was starting to think your old man wasn't every going to let your resurface.
  }
\end{quote}

Looking over to his best friend to for a response, his eyes could another familiar figure. \emph{`Ah man, Tatsuki's on guard duty. It'll be ages before she response now.'} Haruto thought.

\textbf{\sffamily{You should have just waited for her to message us.}} QB9 commented. \textbf{\sffamily{Now, I've got to live with you whining all day about it.}}

Before Haruto could make himself scarce, Tatsuki's head snapped in his direction. Haruto flushed, but held her eyes at her disapproving look. \emph{`Well, we're caught now.'} Haruto thought. The short look the Princess gave her Head Retainer made Haruto sure, his friend had come to the same conclusion.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    MPrincess: Still debatable whether I'll be resurfacing anytime soon, Haru.\\
    MPrincess: It's always good to be back, Haru. Although, you could have waited another ten minutes for me to get to my room.
  }
\end{quote}

Tatsuki looked at her charge before turning her attention straight ahead. Haruto smiled as his BISM buzz for another message. QB9 brought it up without prompting.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    MPrincess: Now, I'm going to have to listen to a thirty minute lecture on decorum.\\
    MPrincess: Your heroism, SB3-QB9, is dully noted.
  }
\end{quote}

\emph{`Hey! What have I said about sending her messages?'} Haruto questioned harshly.

\textbf{\sffamily{The Princess is my friend too.}} QB9 replied harshly.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    MPrincess: Haru, please. QB9 doesn't have anyone else to talk too.
  }
\end{quote}

Haruto frowned, the Princess was \emph{his} friend first.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    MPrincess: Share, Haru.\\
    GhostHacker: Fine. Fine. But I don't have to like it.
  }
\end{quote}

\textbf{\sffamily{How was the trip? Meet anyone interesting?}} QB9 questioned easily ignoring Haruto's lingering frustration. \textbf{\sffamily{Share, \emph{Haru}.}} QB9 mocked.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    MPrincess: Interesting? Maybe. But the trip was mostly tedious.\\
    GhostHacker: Ignore QB, you can tell us all about it like normal.\\
    MPrincess: I should be properly free in three days.\\
    MPrincess: Normal time. I'll unlock the window. Uncle was not pleased the last time you let yourself in.\\
    GhostHacker: If they didn't want just anyone to get in, then they should have better security.\\
    MPrincess: *smiley face*\\
    MPrincess: Arguable, we have the best security on KTS Kanopos.\\
    GhostHacker: Arguable, I have the best security on Kanopos.\\
    SB3-QB9: Get a room, you too.
  }
\end{quote}

\emph{`QB!'} Haruto thought in surprise. 

\textbf{\sffamily{What? This way, you know I'm talking to you both. Clearly you can't complain.}} QB9 replied to him.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    MPrincess: Don't argue, Haru. It's a good idea for QB9 to be on record.\\
    MPrincess: You'll need a proper handler, though SB3-QB9.\\
    GhostHacker: So, now we're inviting him into our chats too.\\
    MPrincess: It's not a members only club, Haruto.
  }
\end{quote}

Haruto bite back his reply as he jumped along the rooftops following in the Princess' wake.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    SB3-QB9: How about Kitsune?\\
    GhostHacker: I don't know, I like FoxFace better.\\
    MPrincess: Why not Foxy999? I believe you're going for the nine-tale fox, correct?\\
    GhostHacker: The what?\\
    Foxy999: Read you're history kid.\\
    GhostHacker: Why are we spending so much time on QB again?\\
    GhostHacker: You just got back. Please tell me you brought me something?\\
    MPrincess: You know I did. A little something for you both, truthfully.\\
    MPrincess: I'm even told it matches your hair.\\
    Foxy999: Us both?\\
    MPrincess: Yes, you will tell me honestly if you like it, QB9?\\
    GhostHacker: Of course, he'll like it. You were thinking of us, so it'll be perfect.
  }
\end{quote}

Haruto stopped at the edge of a building as the Princess and her entourage entered the Gento Kanopos compound. A small section of three interlocking buildings that disguised their importance.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    MPrincess: You always say that Haru, which is why I'd appreciated it if at least QB9 was honest with me.\\
    GhostHacker: Can't be anymore...
  }
\end{quote}

His message was sent abruptly as he felt his SKIM link with another. A shadow loomed over him as he was yanked from his feet. Looking up he come eyes to one eyes to Guardian Inugami. ``Ah, long time no see, Inugami.'' Haruto replied hesitantly.

The Guardian's visible eye wrinkled into a smile. ``It's not like you to let your guard slip. Eh, little Haruto.''

``Ha.'' Haruto replied dryly as he resigned himself to being captured for who knows why. ``This wouldn't happen to be a teaching moment would it, Inugami?''

``Sorry to say it isn't.'' Guardian Inugami replied with a smile. 

``Should I even ask what I've done this time?'' Haruto smiled sweetly. Sometimes if the offense was low enough, he could talk the Guardian into letting off with some easy chores. Of course that depended on the Guardian's mood.

Inugami shrugged in response. ``No clue, but the Sakr\'{a} get's what he wants.'' Pulling Haruto over his shoulder, Inugami continued. ``Come on, you can talk to your girlfriend later.''

Haruto blushed, ``The Moon Princess is my best friend!'' His BISM took that moment to buzz. Inugami's eye crinkled in question. ``She's been gone for like forever!'' Haruto defended. ``We're catching up.''

``Well, catch up with your \emph{friend} later.'' Inugami replied as he readjusted the redhead. ``The Sakr\'{a}'s is a waiting.''

Haruto sighed as he relaxed into Inugami's grip. There was no way he was getting out of this.

\textbf{\sffamily{But I bet we can con the old man into some fancy food.}} QB9 commented. \textbf{\sffamily{I call this a win.}}

\chapter{}

Inugami didn't believe in doors. With Guardian Kamaitachi, Haruto could be sure that they'd use the door. Well nine times out of ten. But that might as well be all the time compared to Guardian Inugami. So, yeah. Inugami didn't believe in doors.

Haruto landed on all fours as the Guardian unceremoniously dropped him. Dry heaving as his senses came back to him. Haruto shut his eyes tightly as the room continued to spin. Sooner than normal, his world returned to normal.

\textbf{\sffamily{What in all the dimensions was \emph{that}?}} QB9 demanded.

\emph{`Welcome to Guardian transport, QB.'} Haruto replied as Inugami picked up him gently.

``Easy now, Haruto. When was the last time you ate something.'' Inugami asked gently as he helped him up.

\textbf{\sffamily{They didn't do that last time.}} QB9 complained.

Haruto shrugged at them both as he whipped his mouth. \emph{`Kamaitachi's not big on using it. I think there's a large energy consumption or something.'} Haruto continued in his mind. \emph{`It's a Guardian AIM thing. I'm still not sure exactly how it works.'}

``Here,'' Inugami replied as he handed Haruto a protein bar. ``It wouldn't have effected you so much, if you took better care of your body, little Haruto.''

Haruto stomach rebelled at the idea of food, but he knew from experience this always helped. ``You could have used to door.'' Haruto eyed the Guardian with a frown.

Inugami chuckled as he led them out of the receiving room.

\textbf{\sffamily{We were in one place one second, and another place another. What type of dark magic is this?}} QB9 demanded harshly.

\emph{`It's not magic, QB. Honest.'} Haruto replied as he followed the Guardian through the winding halls of Command Center. \emph{`It actually took us about thirty seconds or so. It just feels instantaneous.'}

QB9 was silent for a long second before he replied, \textbf{\sffamily{So light speed?}} The disbelief was evident in his voice.

\emph{`Not quiet that fast, QB9. But yeah, we just moved really, really fast.'} Haruto replied disposing the recycled wrapper into his SKIM. He stretched as he placed his hands behind his head. \emph{`That much I've figured out. I just can't figure out how we got on this side of the building without using a door.'} He continued in his head looking around at the hustle and bustle of officers and enlisted alike. \emph{`There must be a door. I just haven't found it yet.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{What about the Princess? Surely she should know.}} QB9 questioned slightly less hostile.

\emph{`Oh, she might know, but that would be cheating.'} Haruto replied as they passed into a familiar waiting room.

``Alright Haruto, you know the drill.'' Inugami said as he turned to Haruto.

The old man's secretary gave him the stink eye, Haruto responded with a raspberry. ``Come on, Inugami. Don't make me stay here.'' Haruto begged giving his best innocent face.

Inugami's hand rubbed in Haruto's hair affectionately. ``Try not to get into too much trouble, eh?''

``But I haven't done anything wrong. Honest! I've just been studying in KOAL.'' Haruto tried harder. If there was anyone that could be convinced to let him off the hook for whatever real or imaginary slight Haruto had inflicted it was Guardian Inugami.

``Sorry kid. If I let you go, Guardian Kamaitachi's just going to pick you up in an hour. The Sakr\'{a} was serious about getting you here today,'' the Guardian replied. ``You'll be fine.''

Haruto's face turned into a large pout at the answer.

\textbf{\sffamily{Oh, just sit down, kid. You're whining is giving me a headache.}} QB9 complained.

``Fine.'' Haruto relented as he plopped down on one of the familiar waiting chairs outside of the old man's office. ``But you owe me, Inugami.''

\textbf{\sffamily{You can't be seriously. He's a Guardian, he's not going to be...}}

``Sure kid.''

\emph{`He's not going to what exactly, QB9?'} Haruto thought as he smiled up at the Guardian.

``I'll see you sometime next week, Haruto.'' Inugami replied with a small wave before disappearing in a blink. The smell and sound of the Guardian's exit still permeating the air.

``Hey,'' Haruto called out to the secretary. ``When's the old man going to be out?''

``When he'd ready, Cadet H\={e}id\`{o}ng and not a minute before.'' She replied sharply eyes still on her Halo screen. 

\textbf{\sffamily{This seems like an excellent time to practice, patience.}} QB9 replied with a sharp snort. \textbf{\sffamily{Or study, you pick.}}

The idea of listening to Aeliana drone on for even another second caused Haruto to twist his face into horrifying expression.

\textbf{\sffamily{Patience it is.}} QB9 replied with a dark chuckle.

Haruto snapped out of it, frowning at the AIM. \emph{`Not cool, QB9. Not cool.'} He replied as he crossed his arms, Haruto settled down to wait. And wait. And \emph{wait}. Tapping his foot noisily for what felt like hours before he gave up. Bursting out of his seat, he went over to bother the old man's secretary.

``Hey lady, when's the old man going to be out? It's been like hours.'' Haruto could already fill QB9's annoyance at his comment, but the secretary spoke before the AIM had a chance.

``Cadet H\={e}id\`{o}ng you've been here for five minutes.'' Looking up from her Halo screen, she gave him a suffering expression. ``The \emph{Sakr\'{a}} will be out after he's done with his meeting. Go back over there and wait, and stop that insufferable tapping.''

Haruto huffed in frustration before plopping back down into his seat. 

\textbf{\sffamily{I like her.}}

\emph{`Of course you do.'} Haruto replied as he contemplated tapping his fingers along the window seal instead. He considered it for a long second, QB9's amusement in the background, before deciding it wasn't worth it.
The secretary may not have liked him, but she was mean to him. 

\textbf{\sffamily{Good decision, kid.}} QB9 commented. \textbf{\sffamily{I was ten seconds away from crapping your SKIM and not cleaning it up for an hour, again.}}

Haruto paled at the comment. QB9 had only done that once, but once had been the lesson learned. \emph{`You could have asked me to stop first.'} Haruto replied accusatory.

\textbf{\sffamily{What? And ruin my entertainment.}} QB9 gave a dark chuckle in response.

The AIM was evil. Just pure evil. Turning to his BISM, he checked his missed message.

\begin{quote}
  {\fontfamily{cmss}\selectfont
    MPrincess: I'll see you in three days. Try to stay out of too much trouble until than, Haru.
  }
\end{quote}

Looking around the Sakr\'{a}'s office, Haruto gave a long sigh. \emph{`Easier said then done.'} Closing the message, he pulled up the audio file from the vid he'd been studying earlier. ``Rail guns, here we come.'' He muttered under his breath as the file resumed with Aeliana's monotoned voice.

\starbreak

\emph{Zip. Zip.} Haruto snapped awake for the umpteenth time as he realized there was no audio playing.

\emph{`Gods above, QB!'} Haruto cursed. \emph{`I had that on auto play for a reason!'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Stop whining. You'll thank me in a second.}} QB9 replied.

Half a second later, and the old man's door slide open. \emph{`How did he...'}

``Yes, yes, Masaru. I will of course bring up your points to the council.'' The Sakr\'{a} replied as he waved some stuff old Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng out of his office.

``Don't you patronize me, Hwasan. The continued encroachment of those two-bit merchants will not be allowed to continue.'' Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng snapped back barely civil. ``The laws are on my side on this.''

``And the Helians know that, which is why they are only renting space from those Clans that no longer require it.'' Old man. ``Which we just spent that better part of an hour discussion.'' Old man points to the door. ``Now, I have another meeting.'' Old man nodded to Haruto causing Haruto to snap to attention.

The Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng gave Haruto a once over in a face that reminded him of Akihiko. In fact, it was identical to Akihiko's your-not-worth-the-dust-on-my-boots look. \emph{`That must be his stuck up dad.'} Haruto thought as he didn't even wiggle out of attention. Back ramrod stiff. Arm unmoved.

``Careful, Hwasan.'' The Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng turned back to the old man. ``That your sentimentalities don't continue to weaken KTS Kanopos.'' The Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng turned to leave, ``If it continues, the Clan Council just might decide a change in leadership is appropriate.''

``Careful, Masaru.'' The old man replied, a glint in his eyes, ``Someone might accuse you of mutiny given that only the Great and Honorable Jade Emperor gives power to the Sakr\'{a}.''

The Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng snorted at the comment, but didn't say anything else as he left.

\textbf{\sffamily{Well that was intense.}} QB9 replied.

\emph{`Yeah,'} Haruto thought worriedly. He didn't want anything to happen to the old man. Especially not because of him.

``At ease, Cadet.'' The Sakr\'{a} spoke after a moment of silence passed. Haruto blinked before he realized he was still at attention.

Smiling sheepishly, he relaxed. The old man smiling back at him. ``Why little Haruto, that is quite the salute.''

Haruto beamed at him as the old man motioned for him to step into his office. ``I can do the Keeper one even better.''

``Oh, don't I know it.'' The old man eyes twinkled as he spoke. ``Now, I know you must be wondering why I called you here...''

\starbreak

Patting his stomach, Haruto hummed a little jingle as he walked easily down the street. He'd parted ways with the old man a little while back. 

\textbf{\sffamily{I'm not sure why you're so happy.}} QB9 growled lightly. \textbf{\sffamily{He's bribing us. Trying to take out the sting of the meeting earlier.}}

``And it's working.'' Haruto replied aloud as he pat his stomach contently again.

\textbf{\sffamily{Common trash.}} QB9 muttered angrily. \textbf{\sffamily{What will you tell the Princess!? Huh? We just got kicked out of the library. How will we study now!?}} QB9 raged on. \textbf{\sffamily{OCI!?}}

\emph{`Calm down, QB9.'} Haruto replied his expression sobering. \emph{`It's not the end of the world. I've had worse setbacks, this is nothing.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Nothing!}} QB9 roared. \textbf{\sffamily{OCI is everything. We need KOAL.}}

\emph{`And we still have it.'} Haruto replied easily. \emph{`We can still go once a week,'} Haruto continued quickly before QB9 could interrupt. \emph{'And we'll still have all of the KANP notes. Those aren't at KOAL, QB.'} Haruto gave the AIM a moment to calm further down.

\textbf{\sffamily{And you think the Helian girl will still help us, outside of the library?}} QB9's question was surprisingly hesitant. \textbf{\sffamily{She doesn't even give us a backwards glance in class.}}

Haruto waved his concerns away as he continued to walk home, \emph{`Aeliana will need us to help with her Showcase.'} At QB9's disbelief Haruto continued, \emph{`Sure, she's not going to happy about the arrangement, but will figure something out even if I have to clean my apartment and work from there.'} Turning down a back alley, he continued, \emph{`No worries, QB. That's what the Princess will tell you too. No worries.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Tell her now, then.}} QB9 demanded.

\emph{`Princess? She already said she was too busy right now, QB.'} Haruto replied confusingly.

\textbf{\sffamily{No, you \emph{idiot}.}} QB9 cursed. \textbf{\sffamily{\emph{Helian}.}}

``Ah,'' Haruto replied as he stopped in a dead space on instinct. Checking for cameras, he nodded to himself before opening up his BISM and connecting to the GH network.

\textbf{\sffamily{I don't see why you won't let me send her the message.}} QB9 whined.

\emph{`Because if you do it wrong, I'll be sitting in jail for a month.'} Haruto replied as he located Helian's signature. ``I hate that place.'' He continued aloud. ``It always smells like butt.'' He muttered under his breath.

\textbf{\sffamily{That's a tough little network security. Sure you don't want my help.}} QB9 commented.

``No, I don't.'' Haruto answered. \emph{`Shouldn't be surprised the Guild Headquarters has it's own network to work around.'} He thought to himself. ``There!''

\textbf{\sffamily{You're in?}} QB9 responded. \textbf{\sffamily{That didn't take as long as I thought it would.}}

\emph{`I'll take that as a compliment.'} Haruto replied as he hacked into Aeliana's BISM.

Screech!!!

``Star dust!'' Haruto cursed, exiting quickly.

\textbf{\sffamily{What happened?}} QB9 \textbf{\sffamily{I thought you had it working out.}}

``So did I.'' Haruto muttered as he looked at his access point again. \emph{`Everything looks fine. I'm not sure what went wrong.'}

Trying again, gets same screeching noise.

\emph{`Okay, so not going to work.'} Haruto thought as he leaned against the building in the dead zone.

\textbf{\sffamily{Interference from the Headquarters network?}} QB9 supplied.

Haruto shook his head, \emph{`There security's good, but not Tower One good.'} Haruto paused in thought. \emph{`And Aeliana only has a basic guidance chip, there really should be no problem on their end.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Well, then what do we do now.}} QB9 questioned frustration leaking into his voice.

\emph{`Now,'} Haruto pushed off the building before starting towards a nearby terminal. ``Now, it's time I showed you Red Sector.''

\chapter{}
Bending his knees, Haruto absorbed his fall from the terminal tube. Crouching for a second longer, he took a deep breath before pulling himself up right properly.

\textbf{\sffamily{Why are we here, kid?}} QB9 questioned as Haruto got a running jump onto the ladder to the rooftops of the nearby building.

\emph{`Well, we're going to go into the heart of the Red Sector. It shouldn't take that long.'} Haruto replied as he jogged along the rooftops, keeping his footsteps light. Mind half on the Keeper patrols that would be out this close between sectors.

QB9 gave a low growl in frustrations. Haruto waved away the feeling. \emph{`The feedback, QB. I've got to fix it. The last thing I need is interference during a prank.'} Haruto shivered at the thought.

Haruto let QB9 think on that as he slowed his jog. The last thing he wanted was to meet someone else up here. An ominous shadow to his right, pushed him to the left. Avoiding confrontation was the best way to win it.

\textbf{\sffamily{The Ghost Hacker network.}} QB9 replied. \textbf{\sffamily{You mentioned it was here, in Lower Level.}}

\emph{`Yup!'} Haruto replied as he paused at the edge of the rooftop. Looking down at the trash filled streets, pockets of street gambling and dirty figures that would have looked more at home in the Blue Sector filtered in and out of buildings. 

Despite knowing that the majority of dock workers and temps found residency here, Haruto was always surprised by the number of them wearing coveralls. Another reason why he didn't care to walk on the streets without a disguise. He stood out like a sore thumb.

\textbf{\sffamily{I also distinctly remembering you mentioning some super crazy woman that lived nearby.}} QB9 added with some skepticism. \textbf{\sffamily{How exactly are we supposed to get past her?}}

\emph{`We aren't.'} Haruto replied as leaned over the other wall. Finding fewer souls about, he scaled down. 

\textbf{\sffamily{Haruto...}} QB9 growled his name not at all happy to be ignored.

\emph{`Give me a second.'} Haruto jogged quickly across the street before scaling back up to the rooftops. \emph{`There no catwalk to link the sections, and this place is a pain to be caught on the ground.'}

A low chorus of voices caused Haruto to duck behind the buildings emergency exit. Sliding slowly and quietly around, he dashed off to the next rooftop. \emph{`Anyway, what were we talking about?'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Crazy lady.}} QB9 replied.

\emph{`Oh, yeah. We don't get past her. We just have to hope she's not around.'} Feeling QB9's anger Haruto was quick to add more, \emph{`Look, she can go off ship for like months. So, it's not that bad.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{So, some how we get to the GH network. Then what? Blow on it.}} QB9.

Haruto sneak passed another group too busy gambling and smoking to look his way before he answered. \emph{`Don't be difficult QB. We debug it.'} Jumping to the next rooftop, he rolled and crawled passed a group of mean looking mercenaries.

\textbf{\sffamily{They could be anything.}} QB9 demanded.

\emph{`Not with those badges.'} Haruto replied as he stayed low to the ground. \emph{`That's the sign for the Guild muscle.'} Haruto continued. When they were passed, he turned to get a second look at one of the bigger guys. \emph{`And definitely not with those blasters hiding in their coveralls.'}

QB9 snorted, but didn't disagree. It was times like these that Haruto was reminded that his AIM still had a lot to learn. It was only as the noise of Red Sector started to decrease that Haruto chanced a look into the streets. Fewer people roamed here. \emph{`Almost there, QB.'} Haruto replied as he made his way across another building. \emph{`And there it is,'} Haruto pointed to a four story building about a block from their position. \emph{`Now, we've got to wait a minute or too to see if the crazy lady is here.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{How will we know from here, kid? We can't see anyone on the streets from this distance.}} QB9 complained.

\emph{`Oh, we'll know.'} Haruto added as he sat on the edge of the rooftop to wait. \emph{`Besides, you don't want to be any closer, just in case she's here. She doesn't take well to well, anyone really. Best to just stay out of her way.'}

There were silent for several minutes before QB9 spoke, \textbf{\sffamily{This is ridiculous.}} He growled in frustration. \textbf{\sffamily{How can you possible maintain the network when you have to go through all of this trouble just to get there?}}

\emph{`Oh, I don't have to go in person to do low network maintenance and updates, QB. That would just be silly. Anyone would follow me, and it would increase the likelihood the crazy lady found out about it.'} Haruto replied as his eyes stayed on the dirty streets of Red Sector. \emph{`No, I do the small stuff at my apartment. I only have to do hardware debug like this in person.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{You can't possible know it will be hardware.}} QB9.

\emph{`No, but I built the network to fix small software errors automatically. Just a little machine learning that auto checks its systems hourly.'} Haruto replied easily. \emph{`I've actually only needed to go back to it once and that was a couple of years ago now. Had to fix a location finder bug.'}

Nodding to himself, he jumped down into the empty side street before making his way towards the abandoned building housing the GH mainframe. The streets were nearly deserted at his building. Haruto gave a hesitant look at the crazy lady's building next to it.

\textbf{\sffamily{What's here, besides residential area?}} QB9 asked.

Haruto moved around the boarded up front door to the side alley to find his hidden entrance. \emph{`Ah, well. Lots of bars, gambling dens legal and illegal alike. A couple of bar and grills, and of course the brothel houses of Kanopos.'}

Finding the entrance, Haruto hooked his BISM into the keypad beginning his de-encryption. He sighed as he watched the program work. \emph{`I really should add a master key for this thing.'} He thought to himself.

\textbf{\sffamily{Why do they call this Red Sector?}} QB9 questioned. \textbf{\sffamily{Is it some play off of those old Red Light Districts?}}

``What?'' Haruto accidentally questioned aloud in his confusion. \emph{`Red light what now?'}

\textbf{\textsc{Access granted.}} His BISM screen flashed followed by the click of the light.

QB9 sighed heavily, \textbf{\sffamily{How is it I know your history better than you do?}}

\emph{`Because you stole a metric ton of KANP documents?'} Haruto replied sarcastically as he slide the heavy metal door down enough for him to squeeze through.

\textbf{\sffamily{Red Sector, kid. Why the name? I get Black Sector with the black light and Blue Sector with the blue light. But no red light anywhere here.}}

As if to contradict QB9, at that moment the soft white light turned to red. QB9 flushed in anger. Haruto slide into the building pulling it closed behind him as he continued in the almost complete darkness of the abandon building. \emph{`Red Sector's on a different light savor time table than Black, Blue and even Green Sectors. But in general the Sectors of Lower Level are named after the light used.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{Well it's obvious now.}} QB9 replied sharply. \textbf{\sffamily{What's the time tables?}}

Haruto picked his way carefully as he headed further down into the building. A tunnel he'd built himself into connect to Kanopos' main energy lines. \emph{`Black's on 20/4, black/white cycle. Five hours of black followed by one hour of white, which is normally timed with the compactors.'} Haruto found a hard steel door and opened the access panel. \emph{`Blue's on 2/1, blue/white cycle. Two hours blue followed by one hour of white.'} Putting his hand on the panel, a eye hole opened to scan his retina.

\textbf{\textsc{Access granted. Welcome H\={e}id\`{o}ng Haruto.}}

\textbf{\sffamily{Where in the worlds did you get the tech for this security?}} QB9 questioned as they stepped into a cooled room. Inside wall to wall of beaten up looking servers.

Haruto smiled as he walked to the work bench. \emph{`You won't believe what people throughout.'} Haruto replied. ``This took the better part of four years to construct. Although, some pieces I've had for even longer.''

To prove his point, Haruto touched an old KANP tablet he used as his access screen. Some day, he'd get a Halo screen for it, but that was a long time away. ``Anyway, Red Sector's just been downgraded to a 14/10, red/white cycle. All in one block as close as they can get to match Solas.'' Haruto continued aloud as he logged into the Ghost Hacker mainframe. ``When I was ten, it matched Solas' 16/8, white/dark cycle. But I guess Kanopos keeps out growing beyond it's power usage.'' Haruto continued in a mutter.

\textbf{\sffamily{This is impressive.}} QB9 replied. \textbf{\sffamily{But what happens when the power goes out, or this energy savor cycle turns on.}}

``Nothing.'' Haruto replied as he began to run a full diagnostics on the network. ``I've got the mainframe powered using some old main energy line. Took forever to dig at, and even longer to hack into.'' Haruto's eyes followed the output as he continued under his breath. ``I didn't even know people still used analog in their system setups.'' Haruto nodded to another sealed off section. ``And backing up that line is a backup generator that has about 72 hours of diesel. And backing up \emph{that} backup generator is a power wall I built that's hooked up to the Kanopos backup solar cells. That will last two weeks at full server capacity.''

The princess had talked him down from connecting to another dozen of the cells given how hard it had been to acquire Walking equipment. \emph{`That and the danger of unauthorized spacing walking.'}

\textbf{\sffamily{A little paranoid aren't we?}} QB9 responded.

Haruto shook his head, ``I don't have any of this tech on backup drives.'' Haruto nodded around. ``If I loss this, I have to start from scratch for everything.'' \emph{`And that's not happening.'}

The makeshift monitor blinked red, Haruto's eyes immediately went to the highlighted text. A frown tugging at his lips.

\textbf{\sffamily{What is it, kid?}} QB9 questioned, \textbf{\sffamily{I don't see anything odd, here.}}

Haruto shook his head as he ran a more specific diagnostic, more of a search algorithm than anything else. ``I've already accounted for the Guild network frequencies, along with Kanopos main series, DOMAINE, KANP, Keepers, even the short bursts from the Guardian comms. Can't decrypt most of them, but I know their signals and so does GH.''

The second program finished with more of the same results, \textbf{\sffamily{So this unaccounted frequency is part of a new network?}} QB9 half questioned half answered. \textbf{\sffamily{Is that so rare?}}

``Illegal, more like.'' Haruto commented as he turned to his emergency toolbox next to his make shift console. ``But I've got extra signal filters for when any of the others fail.'' He continued as he dug out the parts in question. A couple of resistors adjusted and band pass filters identical to the six frequency filters already in the GH mainframe. Adjusting the filter to the new frequency, he turned to the mainframe.

Opening up the mainframe, he by passed the power to the filters section before plugging in the new addition. ``There that should fix the problem.'' He spoke aloud as re-introduced the filters section to power. Typing away at his console, Haruto re-ran his full diagnostics. Sitting back he watched it work.

\textbf{\sffamily{And you're not at all concerned about an illegal frequency?}} QB9's voice grated. A peeved expression lacing Haruto's own.

Shrugging Haruto replied, ``They pop up from time to time.'' He let that sit for a moment longer, \emph{`Although normally only in the Blue Sector,'} he added mentally. 

QB9 growled in frustration, \textbf{\sffamily{So this one reaching all of Lower Level, Solas and probably all of the other Sectors doesn't scream massive plot to destroy the world.}} 

The AIM's sarcasm was palatable. Haruto rolled his eyes at the dramatics. ``Calm down, QB,'' He replied, but the AIM's mood still raged on. With a sigh, Haruto leaned back into his console. Pulling a second window up and began the work of pin-pointing the signal origins.

Haruto worked in silence for several long minutes. ``Sneaky little thing.'' Haruto muttered as he studied the new frequency. Like this it had a good chance of going undetectable at least by the Keepers' normal cyber security measures.

\textbf{\sffamily{See!}} QB9 cried out in outrage. \textbf{\sffamily{Nefarious intentions that must be challenged.}}

``I said might.'' Haruto replied sharply. ``There's a reason why, I didn't choose to use this method when I was building the GH network.'' He continued. While a naturally occurring signal, the frequency was just a tad to regular and frequent to be fully normal. Voicing this he continued, ``Eventually the Keepers will spot the regularity to it. It might take a week, month or even a year or so, but they'll eventually spot it. Which is why I hop around on pre-existing networks. It's pretty hard to trace something that doesn't stand still.''

\textbf{\sffamily{Even if you hop, you'll have a pattern. Surly that will be traceable.}} QB9 replied in disbelief.

Haruto shook his head, ``Only if it was a predictable pattern, QB.'' Exiting out of the window, he focused back on his AIM. ``Look, there's a reason I've sent so much of my time on randomization. My randomized network algorithm is by far my biggest achievement.'' 

QB9 still seemed unconvinced. ``There's only one natural frequency for them to emulate. Even if they wanted to, they couldn't change to another frequency. Eventually, they get caught. While the Keepers will be chasing my signal, if they even know to look for centuries.''

\textbf{\sffamily{A year is a lot of time to enact damage, boy.}} QB9 countered. His voice laced with unease.

``Alright, alright. I promise I'll talk with the Princess about it later. Is that enough?''

Haruto could feel QB9's smug agreement, \textbf{\sffamily{Yes. I trust she'll take this seriously.}}

Turning back to his diagnostic program, Haruto changed to topic, ``Now, I believe we have other issues to deal with.''

Fingers tapping away on his BISM, Haruto was pleased at the ease of which he could now access Aeliana's BISM. \emph{`Better to just get to the point.'} He thought as he sent his message.

\textbf{\textsc{Hey! Sorry looks like I got kicked out of KOAL.}}

\textbf{\sffamily{Don't word it like that!}} QB9 chastened in a low growl. \textbf{\sffamily{She'll think we can't go at all.}}

Haruto rolled his eyes, but sent a second message to clarify.
\textbf{\textsc{Well, not everyday. Just like I can't go more than once a week.}} Before QB9 could speak again, Haruto was already sending another message. \textbf{\textsc{Hope you got another place we can go too. :) :)}}

\textbf{\sffamily{Were the smiley faces necessary?}} QB9 commented dryly.

\emph{`Of course they were, QB. It's called aesthetic. You could learn to use it.'} Haruto replied. Haruto watched the diagnostic as they waited for a reply.

\emph{Buzz. Buzz.}

\textbf{\textsc{88I'll ThiNK oF\#\# soMEthINg.\&\%7}}

At the same time, the diagnostic finished. ``There, QB9. No problem at all.''

\textbf{\sffamily{I still don't like this.}} QB9 complained discontentedly.

``You don't like much.'' Haruto commented dryly as he logged off his console. QB9 growled in response, but said nothing else. Soon enough Haruto was back outside. \emph{`Look QB, honestly the phantom network will probably be gone in a week or two.'} Haruto tried to soothe the AIM as he stepped into the red light of Red Sector.

Heaving the metal grate over his basement access point, he continued \emph{`And if it doesn't, we'll...'} Haruto paused in thought as a familiar figure caught his attention. \emph{`Is that Lieutenant Sang-eo?'}

\textbf{\sffamily{What?}} QB9 questioned as Haruto watched the figure enter the building next to his. \textbf{\sffamily{The man going into the crazy lady's building?}}

\emph{`Yeah that one.'} The AIM's disbelief was just as clear as Haruto's own. Tentatively, he stepped out into the street as he watched the place for more signs of movement. \emph{`There's just no way, right?'} The thought caught him staring out in the open.

\textbf{\sffamily{Move kid.}} QB9 replied softly. \textbf{\sffamily{We'll look into it later.}}

Haruto nodded in agreement, \emph{`Sure.'} Turning to go, he glanced behind him one more time. He had to be wrong.
