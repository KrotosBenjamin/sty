\chapter{}
<This should be a chapter from Yakei point of view... Not sure what it will be yet...>
<There should also be lead up to the Jade Festival... Haruto had promised something memorable...>

This is an empty filler chapter... Need something between this and the Jade Festival...

Some lead up, maybe she should break up with her girl friend here. Actually, that's a pretty good idea... This would give us a reason for her to be on her own for the Jade Festival...

<I want to show the real struggle she's having. Thinking about the Shadow organization. KTS Kanopos. OCI, just everything, and Ilia says something frillious. Also jealousy, because Haruto sees her more than she does.>

Aeliana's knee was knocked gently as Ilia leaned into her. Her friend's face alight as she dove into her current experiments with hybrid flowers. Aeliana could feel a second hand enjoyment simply from the contact high.Taking a bite of her lunch, she smiled in response, nodding along to a conversation she was only partly following.

These moments, growing smaller with every passing day, were what she lived for. Just sitting next to her best friend as they enjoyed the delights of one of their favorite street vendors off Solas Plaza. The two of them alone in a world of their own. No Clans, no KANP, no OCI, no Guild, or disapproving parents. Here, the only thing that mattered was the good food and the better company. \emph{'We'll get to do this for two more years at least.'}\ Aeliana thought.

With KANP six times a week, and Ilia always busy in the evening with 'Clan stuff', their time together was rapidly becoming non-existent. She ought to put in more effort. Try to make this, them, work. But... \emph{'I can't give up on becoming a pilot. Not yet, I just can't.'}\ she thought wistfully. And yeah the odds were bad, and when she thought to hard on them they seemed impossible, but she couldn't give up. That just wasn't who she was. It didn't matter what Ilia said, how reasonable her arguments were. Ilia just didn't seem to get it, get \emph{her}. Aeliana held back a snort at the irony. The one thing Ilia seemed to not get about her, and it was probably the most important.

Aeliana held back a sigh as she nodded at the right times to Ilia's story. Only half listening. Ilia could talk for days about flowers. Their growth, breeding, arrangement, what have you. And if she were a civilian, Aeliana honestly doubted either one of them would be in KANP right now. Things would be different. \emph{So}, different. \emph{'But maybe too different.'} The thought caught her by surprise, but it felt right as she studied her friend.

Her eyes tracing the curve of her face. The round of her small nose. The pink of her lips. The light in her blue eyes. A civilian Ilia would probably be someone she'd never recognize. Something she could hardly imagine. \emph{'In that universe, would we have ever even met?'} She questioned herself before violently pushing it a side. It was a thought she hoped never crossed her mind again. Complete unthinkable even with the tension in their relationship. Ilia was so much more than a chance encounter, meant so much more to her.

\emph{'If I can become a pilot, we'll go to OCI together and none of this will have mattered.'} That thought she welcomed as it took her to a place of possibilities. A place where they trained together. Fought together. A place where they were together. \emph{'At least, for a little while.'} She thought wistfully. They'd be bound for different battle ships, she was sure of it. And Ilia did make a good point, if she wasn't a pilot, Aeliana could be her head technician. What was three years of OCI, compared to the span of a pilot's active duty? A lifetime together?

But no matter how she pitched it to herself, she just couldn't wrap her mind around a life as a technician. \emph{'How can I? When every time I close my eyes I see her, the Moon Princess.'} She thought, images of that beautiful ZenKZ-D flashing before her eyes. She wanted the suit, the power, the \emph{control}. \emph{She} wanted to be the Pilot. Not the women behind the machine.

Unfortunately, OCI was little more of dream at this point. A Kanopos Pilot had to have something she didn't have, unique creativity. Perhaps that was why only the Clans seemed to become them. Stabbing viciously at a dumpling, Aeliana couldn't help to think of the in justice of it all. The Clans were literally born into a unique ability. Without it, they had just as much imagination and creativity as she did, if not less! In fact, the only one in their class who seemed to have the so called unique creativity required to be a Kanopos Pilot was none other than H\={e}id\`{o}ng. And that thought alone was enough to make her want to strangle someone.

``And you're not listening to me, are you?''

Aeliana snapped her head up, guilt clouding her features.

Ilia laughed softly, ``No, it's okay. I bore myself sometimes too. Honestly, I'm just glad to know you don't want to skewer \emph{me}.'' Ilia pointed to the dumpling in question causing Aeliana to blush in embarrassment, which just caused Ilia to look even more amused.

Fighting down her blush, Aeliana turned to face her friend, ``By the Goddess, Ilia I'm so sorry. You know I love to hear your talk about your work.''

``But...'' Ilia lifted an elegant eyebrow in question.

``But my head was somewhere else.'' Aeliana admitted reluctantly.

``So, buttercup,'' Ilia began. Aeliana gave her a warning glance, but Ilia looked unfazed. 'Buttercup' was just another in a long list of pet names Ilia seemed to have for her. ``What's going on in that pretty little head of yours?'' She continued.

Sighing she, shifted her eyes away in guilt. There was only one rule when they ate lunch together. Lunch was lunch. No Clan stuff, no KANP stuff, no mention of the Guild, or really anything that could start another argument. And this clearly broke that rule. ``H\={e}id\`{o}ng.'' Aeliana replied impulsively. Ilia's face a blank mask, stony in its silence. Not wishing to be misunderstood, she continued. ``Well, really KANP in general. And the future and I don't know.'' Aeliana paused as she struggled to articulate her thoughts.

``I mean, H\={e}id\`{o}ng is gifted with this amazing creativity, and he just seems to like, throw it in everyone's face.'' She added. \emph{'My face in particular.'} She continued in her head. ``Like today. What kind of question was that? Does he live in the crawl space or something?''

Ilia seemed to relax at that despite Aeliana's response despite the broken lunch rule. Aeliana chose not to think about why. ``I don't know, Aeli,'' she replied thoughtfully, pausing to give the question serious consideration. ``I mean the only reason I know about her is because she's the heir to her clan. And I only know that because of clan lessons.'' Ilia tapped her chopsticks against her chin in thought. ``You know, I think she's the only clan heir I've never met.''

``Really?'' Aeliana questioned in disbelief. As heir to her clan, Aeliana always thought Ilia had met everyone. But Ilia's nod was sincere. ``But you must at least know her given name?''

Ilia shook her head as she replied, ``It's always been K\={o}taishi. No one's ever called her anything else. I mean, even her dad calls her that. At least that's what Kur-ram says.''

Aeliana nodded in understanding. Now that she was really thinking about it, she didn't even think she'd be able to recognize the Gento heiress if she saw her up close. And how could she? When she'd only ever seen her from a far during the Moon Festival parade. There performing the elegant dance to summon the Moon Princess's true strength. If only for that reason, Aeliana was starting to see how H\={e}id\`{o}ng might confuse her for royalty.

``I guess I kinda like Moon Princess, when you think about it.'' Aeliana spoke aloud.

Ilia paused in thought, ``Yeah, I guess I could see that. Princess and all. It is the name of her future ZenKZ, so why not her too?'' Ilia ate a dumpling before continuing, ``She's lofty enough for the title anyway. Although that's not saying much given her Clan.''

They entered a comfortable silence as they finished their meal. Aeliana's mind drifting to the future as uncertain as it was. Ilia reached over to pay the automat for their lunch. This week it was Ilia's turn to pay. Next week it would be Aeliana's. Although, sometimes she just made them lunch if she was tired of the street vendors options. They couldn't go too far away from KANP given the short amount of time they had.

``Hey,'' Ilia called out grabbing Aeliana's attention, ``I heard a new film is arriving this week. Want to go see it on our free day? We can make a day of it.''

``I...'' Aeliana wanted to say yes. They'd not had a night together in the longest, but she knew she'd need her free day to study. Time was running out, and she still didn't have a unique ability to showcase for the OCI test. But most of all, when Ilia made that face, so hopeful, Aeliana found it hard to say no. ``I can't.'' But she had to.

``Oh.'' Ilia replied her face a mask. Ilia's Game face was one of the only expressions of Ilia's that Aeliana had trouble deciphering.

``I have to help my parents. They're planning another big expedition.'' Aeliana continued. It was true. She did have to help her parents. It just wasn't going to take all day. But this was better than telling Ilia the truth and getting into a huge argument about OCI. Again. She just couldn't. Not right now. She didn't trust her emotions.

Ilia gave a forced smile as they got up to leave, ``I get it. No worries. Maybe next week.''

``Maybe.'' Aeliana returned the strained smile knowing in her heart that until she had something, \emph{anything}, unique to showcase. There would be no next week. Looking at Ilia now, she didn't think she'd fooled her either. Ilia had always seemed to be able to see through even Aeliana's best Game face. She wasn't even sure why she still tried.

Kur-ram and Kenta found their way to Ilia's side as they always seemed to do after lunch was over. Aeliana was just glad they never crashed it. She liked them both well enough. She just didn't need the constant reminder of clan privilege. And only Akihiko seemed to surpass the three of them when they were together for using their clan privilege. She had to deal with that in class, she didn't need to deal with it outside of it.

``You excited for tonight.'' Kenta asked Ilia as he ate another handful of chips. Aeliana tried not to frown at him. He was a sweet kid, won't hurt a butterfly. But he was also the only cadet in class who was allowed to eat. Health condition.

Eyeing the new look to his SKIM she was incline to believe him that he needed a high caloric intake. Well and Ilia had explained it once to her. A requirement for his family AIM or something. That was all well and good, but the bags of chips he was constantly consuming wouldn't produce more than a tenth of his caloric intake. Assuming he did nothing but eat chips all day; he'd still never break even. She'd done the math when Ilia had first told her.

\emph{'No, its those pills you've been popping that keep your calories up.'} Aeliana thought as they continued to talk around her. Ilia had mentioned her evening plans in passing a couple of weeks ago. The three clans, Sakhalin, Krai, and Amur were rotating their positions within their flotilla. Despite how much Ilia had complained about it, it was a pretty big deal as far as their Clan traditions went, tracing its roots from well before KTS Kanopos' founding.

(Either remove, or expand) *For this rotation, it was the Amur clan's turn to lead.*

They made it to KANP soon enough, cutting off the rest of their clan talk, which was a relief. As if the Gods were against her; however, Kur-ram gave a loud groan of displeasure.

``Yeah, I know what you mean.'' Kenta replied as he opened another bag of chips. ``This is going to by so boring.''

``If we're lucky Akihiko might have already told his daddy all about how bored he is.'' Ilia continued.

Kur-ram shook his head, ``Masaru's in a meeting with the Sakr\'{a}.''

``Damn, guess we'll just have to sit through another boring lecture.'' Ilia replied.

Aeliana speed up at the classroom door in the guise of getting to her seat. She didn't look back. Her little world from earlier was deconstructed just as it always seemed to. Much to fast. Far to completely. She just needed to get through the rest of class, and the couple of hours she'd spend in the library afterwards. That always seemed to calm her unnatural rage against the Clans. Tomorrow would be another day. But today, she'd reached her limit. As she took her seat, she found Ilia looking back at her, an unreadable expression on her face.

But that wasn't quite right. Aeliana knew that look and that was the problem. Not able to stand her gaze, Aeliana looked down at her tablet. Reviewing old lecture notes as the rest of the class settled in.

Soon enough the Sergeant was behind his desk ready to start class back up. Moving to a new window, Aeliana was surprised the lecture feed wasn't in her inbox yet. It never took this long for the Sergeant to send them their lectures. Looking up, she found the Sergeant padding himself down in search of the thumbdrive housing his lecture notes. \emph{'That's strange,'} she thought. \emph{'The Sergeant's normally better prepared than this.'}

Of course, if the Sergeant would just send them all of the lectures for the day, or even week, before class he wouldn't be looking completely unprepared now. Waiting impatiently, Aeliana tried to avoid looking at Ilia, who kept glancing back at her every few seconds. \emph{'Come on, Sergeant. Get the class going before Ilia starts sending notes I'm going to want to throttle her for.'}

The Sergeant's face twisted in confusion as he gave his SKIM another once over. \emph{'You've already looked there.'} She thought frustration bubbling to the surface. Honestly, his insistence of live-streaming his lectures were beyond paranoia. H\={e}id\`{o}ng wasn't going to hack into them. \emph{'As if he'd put that much effort into his studies.'} Aeliana thought darkly. ``Goddess forbid he do that.'' She whispered under her breath. And there was no one, but H\={e}id\`{o}ng that could pull something like that off.

\emph{'Although, I wouldn't put it past H\={e}id\`{o}ng to mess with the lecture just for the laughs.'} She thought. In fact, now that she was thinking about it, live-streaming wasn't so bad, if the alternative was H\={e}id\`{o}ng hacking into the lecture and replacing it with garbage. \emph{'Yeah, I suppose I can live with live-streaming. Now if only the Sergeant would get it together.'}

Searching his desk, the Sergeant finally thought to look \emph{inside} it. Pulling his thumbdrive out, he smiled as he plugged the little device into his BISM central control.

\emph{'Finally.'} Aeliana thought as she looked down at her tablet expecting to see the new feed. Instead of the new message, however, her screen flickered before blink off. \emph{'What?'} She thought as she looked back up to see the Sergeant hastily pulling his thumbdrive back out of his BISM.

``What the...'' Someone said from behind her. Confirming that her tablet wasn't the only one acting funny. She started to raise her hand, but the Sergeant was frantically tapping on his BISM, completely oblivious to his surroundings.

``No, \emph{no}, no, nonono, \emph{NO}!'' He chanted from the front right before the room locked down.

An audible click was followed by the flashers descending from the ceiling. Followed by the flashing red lights. The battle stations alert sounded in a high pitch noise. Lights flashing on the floor to the emergency window exits that had popped open.

She automatically stood up, \emph{'Are we scheduled for a drill today...'}

``Code Red, Systems on lock-down. Kanopos Academy for Novice Pilots room 13 under....'' The female automatic voice fell out as her BISM buzzed. \textsc{This is not a drill.} Flashed in bright red blocks of letter before an artistic rendition of a black-hole replaced it.

Deep cold laughter replaced the automatic voice. Frozen in place, a chill ran through her spine. She felt a pinch of pain, she looked back down at her BISM but was met with a black screen. ``Oh no...'' She spoke quietly as the laughter continued to fill the room. \emph{'A virus.'}

Her SKIM flickered in color a sign of the virus interacting with her guidance chip. Looking down at herself, she saw her SKIM had turned into a weird pattern of green and pink. Her neighbors were no better. Looking around, everyone had a bewildered expression on their face as seemingly random colors appeared on the malfunctioning SKIMs.

A flash went off, and Aeliana moved her hand to shield her eyes on instinct.

``How troublesome.'' Kur-ram's voice sounded from the front.

Looking up, she saw what had caught his eye. The Sergeant followed their gaze as a picture of the class was brought up on the blackboard. Aeliana sighed at the image, \emph{'Only H\={e}id\`{o}ng would give them a giant f-u.'} Now the colors made sense. The whole class was a hand gesture that would get her grounded for a week if she every did it in front of her parents. For which she'd learned from experience.

``What is the meaning of...'' The Sergeant began, but the sound of the rest of the building going into Red alert stopped him. More dark laughter echoed from outside of their classroom replacing the automatic voice.

Shutting her eyes tightly against the reality of the situation, she couldn't help her thoughts. \emph{'He's gotten all of KANP.'}

``No.'' The Sergeant replied softly as he looked around. ``The Gods above, this can't be happening.'' His fingers jabbing his BISM again, but it was probably hopeless. At least for a little while anyway, H\={e}id\`{o}ng was unfortunately very good at hacking. And his pranks often lasted for hours, if not days.

``H\={e}id\`{o}ng \emph{HARUTO}!'' The Sergeant yelled as he leaped through a nearby window. Maybe he'd actually seen the blond lingering after a well done prank, but he was probably just trying to get out of here.

``He's definitely getting fired after this.'' Seo-Jun replied as he hopped down, toward the windows and their only way to exit the building. ``On the plus side, we're getting out of this joint early.''

``Small wanders.'' Akihiko replied sarcastically, but his SKIM seemed to already be going back to normal.

Tightening her fist, she felt the pain of her nails biting into her skin acutely. Her eyes found the six clan members in her class. All of their SKIMs seemed to be slowly turning back to normal. \emph{'No, they won't be affected by this much longer, unlike us regular folks.'} She thought bitterly. She'd have to make a trip to a Keeper Tower to get her BISM guidance chip reset, which would erase all of her notes from this week as she only backed up her data on her free day.

Anger boiled within her. \emph{'I could rip H\={e}id\`{o}ng in two for this stunt.'} She didn't care if he had no ambition, \emph{she} was going to be a \emph{Pilot}. She needed this class. Needed the information that the Sergeant was going to provide, because the Clans were \emph{always} on the test. Information which was tightly regulated by the Clans themselves. What she knew, she'd learned from class. She wasn't like Akihiko, or Seo-Jun, or Kur-ram, or even Ilia. That information wasn't just handed to her.

``Hey,'' Ilia's voice spoke softly from her right startling her from her thoughts. ``Since class is canceled, do you want to go to the movies now? It won't be the new film, but I'm sure we can find something to watch.''

Taking a deep breath she centered herself. ``Do I want to go to the movies? \emph{Now}.'' Her tone should have warned Ilia off. Would have warned anyone else to back off, but Ilia continued unaware of the danger.

``Yeah, I mean after we get our AIMs checked out.'' She replied. 

Aeliana barked a sharp laugh fueled with disbelief in response.

``You mean \emph{your} AIM. Goddess.'' She spoke sharply. ``Have you forgotten already that this little civilian only has a \emph{guidance} chip?'' Aeliana's voice rose in response causing some of the remaining students to look in their direction. ``Of did that just slip your mind too?''

``Ah, come on Aeli. You know what I mean.'' Ilia replied softly as if she were talking to a wounded dragon.

``Do I?'' Aeliana felt hysterical laughter pour out from her. ``Do I know what you mean? Or is it that \emph{you} just don't get it. You never seem to get it.''

``Aeliana, maybe we should take this...''

``Somewhere else?'' Aeliana pointed around at the faces staring at them as her voice continued to rise. ``Am I embarrassing you, Ilia? The Clanless Cadet not good enough for you, now?''

``This has nothing to do with your Clan status and you know it.'' Snort. ``Goddess knows you're not some helpless civilian, some nobody. Or does the Helian name mean nothing these days?'' Ilia countered. Aeliana left like she'd been slapped by the sharpness of her friend's tone. ``Look, I know you're upset, and I thought you might like to yell at me some place a little more private. That's all.'' Ilia continued gently. ``Maybe not have it out at me in front of our KANP class?'' Ilia looked at her teasingly, which seemed to have the opposite effect. Her tone patronizing.

``Not everything can be solved with a wink and a smile.'' Aeliana replied sharply.

``Look, I know what this is about. Why don't we...''

But Aeliana cut her off, ``Go somewhere else? Why so you can nod and smile at me without listening?'' 

``What do you except me to do?'' Ilia asked arms crossed as she continued. ``It's always the same argument. OCI this, OCI that. I need to study more, Ilia.'' Her voice mimicking Aeliana's as she ranted. ``What am I supposed to say to that?'' Ilia didn't want for an answer. ``Aeli, you're already smarter than half the class combined. Studying for one more hour isn't going to change that. And the Goddess knows if things were just a little different.'' Ilia cut herself off there. ``But they aren't so, why don't we stop this constant arguing and just enjoy the time we have left together. Have fun for once.''

Aeliana lips tightened in response. ``I didn't come to here to have fun, Ilia, to play games. Not yours, or anyone's head Tech, but a \emph{Pilot}.'' Aeliana can see Ilia's retort before the words leave her mouth and she pushes on and over her friend. ``And I don't care how happy your parents were like that. \emph{We} are not your parents and never will be.''

``Aeliana...'' Ilia looked as if Aeliana had stabbed her. Hurt clouding her eyes.

``By the Goddess, Ilia, I came here, to KANP, to become a \emph{Pilot}.''

``That would be illogical. Why you ask...'' An automated voice sounded from beside them.

``Who dragged you out of a \emph{black-hole}?'' Aeliana snapped, interrupted the boy. Her ire transferred to the intruder. ``Who even are you?''

The cadet adjust his blacked-out goggles. ``We are Haibeu, and have been in your class for the past four years.'' His voice remained the same with only a hint of irritation.

Closing her eyes in frustration, she tried not to look around the classroom. Ilia, of course, had been right earlier. Having this argument in the middle of class was going to bite her later. Or now, as it seemed her classmate decided to add his own thoughts to their fight.

``While we cannot comment on your relationship with Cadet Amur, we believe we should clarify essential facts center to your argument. Why you ask? Because we believe that all conversations, no matter the volume, should have access to all factors for a more meaningful and productive discussion.'' Cadet Haibeu said within a single breath.

``And those would be?'' Aeliana asked with a warning tone. If he didn't get to the point soon, she wasn't sure what she'd do, but feared it would involve violence. And violence against the clan was a serious offense.

``The factor pertaining to your desire to become a Pilot. We have conducted hundreds of thousands of scenarios with regards the to OCI cadets admission. And have come to one singular conclusion in all of them. All seven spots are filled by the Clans.'' Cadet Haibeu replied. ``There is approximately 0.000136\% chance of you obtaining an eighth slot.'' Cadet Haibeu adjusted his goggles. ``Given Cadet H\={e}id\`{o}ng's familiar background and apparent favoritism by the Sakr\'{a}, he has a significantly better chance of obtaining the eighth slot.''

Aeliana felt her face go blank with his input. \emph{'As if this day just couldn't get any worst.'} She thought darkly. But of course it could.

``See, this is what I've been trying to tell you.'' Ilia spoke softly as if a gentle voice would change the words themselves. ``You're amazing, and super talented, and if not for politics and the year you were born into you'd have a spot no problem. But,'' Ilia looked at her deeply. A sadness to her gaze as if it pained her to voice the truth. ``But there's no way that you become a Pilot. No matter how hard you push yourself. This is politics, Aeli. We can't fight politics. Or change it. And I don't, \emph{can't}, watch you break yourself over this impossible dream.'' Ilia's eyes spoke of a story of lose, an apology she wanted so desperately to convey. They begged her to understand. ``Please, let's just go to the movies. Have fun while we can.''

Aeliana expected to be livid in her anger. But all she felt was an emptiness, as if broken. The fight lost from her. Ilia's hand touched her arm gently, pulling her in. And for a moment, Aeliana allowed it.

``I'm so sorry, Aeli.'' Ilia whispered in her ear.

``So am I.'' Aeliana replied just as softly as she pushed herself away and out of Ilia's arms. Ilia's confused face mocking her.

``Aeliana?'' Ilia questioned.

Aeliana felt a sense of clarity in herself as she looked into Ilia's eyes. Clarity and distance. ``I don't think there can be an us anymore, Ilia. As friends, or...'' She spoke as if someone else inhabited her body.

``Come on Aeli. You don't mean that.'' Ilia replied with a weak smile.

``Trust. Faith.'' Aeliana continued. ``Every relationship is built on that.'' Ilia reached out, but Aeliana shied away. ``If you can't have faith in me with this.'' Points around them. ``Then I can't. I just can't keep pretending I'm okay with that.''

``I can be okay with this.'' Ilia replied desperately. ``Goddess, I'll even help you study if that's what it takes.''

But Aeliana was already stepping away from Ilia, physically and mentally. No words could change her decision. In the end, she knew no matter what Ilia said, there would be no change between their wants and desires. They'd be back here again sooner or later. That much Aeliana was sure of. ``I can't.'' Aeliana replied as she turned her back on her one time friend.

``Aeliana, please.'' Ilia begged, pain in her voice.

Aeliana didn't dare look back. ``Goodbye Ilia.'' Stepping out of an exit window she pushed herself forward. They'd always been bound for different circles.

\chapter{}
Aeliana tugged on the fine fabric that made up her coveralls. While intellectually she knew the material was the best the Jade Empire could offer, the constant brush against her skin was aggravating. \emph{`It's such a petty something so beautiful, felt so official.'} She thought as she looked down at the tightly woven coverall. Greens and whites, mixed in with hints of purples told a fine story of the origins of the Guild. 

\emph{`Well, the official part of it.'} It was a poorly kept secret that the Helian family, her family, wealth originated from less than savory places. After all, not all of the original Chasers were after Gods and Demons. Some, like hers, had been in it for the money. But the Helian piracy days were long over, now they celebrated only one Emperor instead of playing the field. 

\emph{`Well, at least on Kanopos.'} She thought with another tug to her coveralls. What her parents did outside of the Jade Empire was none of her concern. 

Laughter bubbled passed her as children sprinted along the crowded streets pulling her out of her thoughts. Two young girls ran passed holding hands, and for a moment Aeliana was in another place, another time. Her thoughts were again interrupted as a small boy bumped into her.

``Sorry.'' He called back as he ran to catch up with his friends.

A long deep sigh escaped her as her eyes took in the Jade Festival around her. Effigies of the current Y\`{u} Hu\'{a}ng Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i} littered the streets. All of the Halo screens having the Emperor's severe face staring down at the people. Beads of jade strung everywhere she looked. But of course, that had nothing on each of the twelve Clans offers. \emph{`Not that I'll get a close look this year.'} She thought.

When the time was right, all of the Halo screens would turn to the big show as the Clans graciously displayed jade statues that would be delivered to the Emperor by the currently honored Keeper unit. A big show of power and money that would take hours with the presentation and the Keeper patrol, Yonaka would gave a long speech before announcing the honored unit for this year. All of it boring. And as her mother liked to call it, \emph{`A pissing contest.'}

And if that wasn't bad enough. The week leading up to this 'festival'{} was party after party all seemingly hosted by the Guild. Really, all she wished was for a reason to miss it all like last year. But the 'I just broke up with my best friend'{} excuse only seemed to work for the one year.

\emph{`Is it really too much to ask for this to be over now?'} She paused in thought looking up hoping the Goddess would be kind to her.

``Ha ha haa!'' A group of laughing KANP students interrupted her prays.

``I guess so,'' she muttered under her breath. As she finally found a stall she didn't recognize.

\emph{`To think, the hardest part if finding something, anything, that doesn't remind me of Ilia.'} She thought as she sat down at the booth. The waiter on duty seemed to recognize her immediately, or at least her Guild coveralls, as he rushed off to have a fierce conversation with his boss.

She slumped her head down just a little pretending to look over the menu, while in reality she was contemplating if her mother would notice her disappearing before the end of the Festival.

\emph{`Probably, Erik seems to have eyes everywhere.'} She sighed as she turned her eyes to the menu proper.

``Hey, I thought that was you, Aeliana.'' A male voice she recognized and wished she didn't spoke from behind her.

Aeliana took a second longer to composer her Game face before turning to her fellow Cadet, ``Akihiko, what a surprise seeing you hear.''

\emph{`Oh, please me passing through. Goddess, please.'} She thought, but her face remained open and friendly.

Instead, Akihiko sat down. Waving the waiter over. ``You have excellent taste it seems. This is an Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng stall. We've five more this year, thanks to father's tireless efforts.'' He replied chest out in pride. ``I'm tasked with visiting them all.'' He continued as the waiter arrived.

``Honorable Akihiko, how may we serve you today.'' The server asked with a short bow.

``Yes, we'll have the special and a pot of Jade tea.'' Akihiko ordered for them both causing Aeliana to push her menu aside. The fact that she'd actually been in the mood for noodles was just another blow to her overall day.

``Of course,'' the waiter bowed again, ``tea will be out right away.''

Akihiko dismissed him with a nod before turning his attention back to her. Clearly, all of the party practice her mother had been making her do recently was paying off, because Akihiko actually smiled back at her despite her worsening mood. 

``Anyway, the Gods must be kind to me today, because this was my last one.'' He added with a smile.

Aeliana smiled back, a little tighter than she probably should have. ``Goddess be praised.''

He snorted at her comment, ``And her too, sure. Honestly, these days my father has more time for me than you do.'' Aeliana moved to apologize, but Akihiko waved it away. ``No, don't worry. I get it.'' He clenched his fist bring Aeliana's eyes to his BISM. For a moment, she thought it flashed green, but in another blink it was back to normal.

``Do you?'' She questioned softly, just another rule of the Game. Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng expected women to be meek, and Akihiko was no different.

He smiled again at her as he nodded. Eyes open, showing a vulnerability he shouldn't have given their limited familiarity. ``Yes. You're going to give your all to getting into OCI, no matter how fruitless the effort might seem.'' He nodded in understanding, ``I respect that.''

Tea arrived interrupting anything he might also have said.

``Thank you.'' Aeliana replied as the waiter poured you a cup. A sip told her, it was brewed with synthetic water. \emph{`A pity, the aroma was so tantalizing.'} She thought as she gently pushed the cup back.

``You're meal will be out shortly.'' The waiter replied with a bow before turning to go.

``Umm,'' Akihiko added after sipping his cup. ``Just amazing, don't you think.''

``It is a very interesting flavor.'' Aeliana replied diplomatically, but Akihiko was the type to hear what he wanted to hear. So her comment only caused him to smile smugly.

``Anyway,'' he began, ``I was thinking...''

Aeliana tuned him out, nodding along at the right place as she let her attention wonder. \emph{`I wonder if Haruto is still working on my polymer?'} She thought. She'd left him in a hurry, knowing she was about to be late to the part of the Festival her mother expected her to attend. \emph{`Did he say he would work on it all night?'} 

``Now that my brother has been promoted to Head Guardian...'' 

Aeliana nodded as she tried to remember Haruto's exact phrasing. \emph{`No, he said it would be working all night.'} She kept her face attentive even as within her she was filled with confusion. \emph{`What in the world is planning to do instead? It can't be the Festival, he's not allowed to these things.'}

``So, of course, I know he doesn't have the time, but...''

\emph{`Well, at least he's running it.'} She thought. As always she'd make steady progress on her potential demonstration, but than run into a space debris. With the TARGET, she'd been able to finally run programs with the Nahua relics going so far as to develop an fool proof illusion protocol. But of course, she couldn't use the relic in her demonstration on the final test. No, she was going to need something portable that could connect to recent technology.

``So, no I study on and off in the flotilla, which is why I'm so busy these days.'' Akihiko paused for the first time.

``Oh, that's great to hear.'' She replied having missed the whole conversation, if it could be called that.

``Yes, and...''

``Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng?'' Aeliana turned sharply at Ilia's voice. Standing just outside of the stall was Ilia, Kur-ram, and Kenta. Ilia looking between Aeliana and Akihiko.

\emph{`Oh Goddess no.'} Aeliana thought. The last thing she wanted was Ilia to think she was even remotely friendly with Akihiko.

``Amur.'' Akihiko replied smugly.

Ilia took a step closer, betrayal in her eyes. Aeliana wasn't sure what to do. Inside she wasn't to yell that she was sitting her against her will, but she was a Helian first and foremost. And she was still in the Game.

``Here you go.'' The waiter replied beside them, ``Two Specials.'' Turning to Aeliana he continued. ``Can I get you more tea?''

``No thank you,'' she replied giving her Game smile. Open and pleasant.

``If you'll excuse us,'' Akihiko spoke to Ilia, ``we're in the middle of something.''

Aeliana turned back to Ilia, and was surprised to see a small smile on her face. ``Cadet Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng,'' she replied easier, ``we're on our way up to the stage, you coming? I'm sure Aeliana will understand. Clan business and all.''

Aeliana tried to hide her elightment at the chance of losing Akihiko, but a glance at Ilia's face told her she wasn't completely successful. \emph{`She could always read me, even when I'm in the Game.'} She thought. To Akihiko, she replied understandingly, ``Yes, Akihiko. Don't let me keep you.''

Akihiko looked embarrassed between them. ``Uh, yeah. I'm okay.'' He replied softly.

Ilia covered her mouth to hide a laugh, ``Don't tell me daddy, doesn't want his dear old second son up their with him?''

Akihiko blushed brightly, ``I have my task, you have yours.'' He replied harshly.

``Is there a problem?'' The manager questioned, eyeing Ilia closely.

``No, sir. We were just going.'' She nodded to Kur-ram and Kenta as she turned to leave. Giving Ilia one last apologetic look. 'I'm sorry '{}.

Aeliana gave her a small smile in return. \emph{`You tried.'}

Akihiko huffed in indignation, ``The gall.'' He shook his head. ``Amur acts like she one of those stuck up Gento. As if we need more of \emph{them}.''

``I am sorry to hear you won't be part of the Festival this year.'' Aeliana replied.

Akihiko nodded distractedly. ``It's not that big a deal. The Jade Festival isn't all that special. Just another chance for the Gento to strut around like they own the place. Honestly, the Sakr\'{a} shouldn't have allowed them to control the Keepers.'' He continued as he dug into his food. ``Treating it like their own private army.''

``A small concession, I'm sure.'' Aeliana replied as she took a tentative bite. The meat tasted like it was also synthetic. An overall, unpleasant dish to go with an unpleasant day.

``Small?'' Akihiko replied already a quarter way through his meal. Aeliana pushed hers around the plate taking very small bites the way her father taught her. ``There everywhere! Not to mention the size of their flotilla.'' He pause to take a couple more bites of food. ``If they turned on us, we'd be hard pressed to turn them back.''

Aeliana nodded along although inside she wanted to argue. The Gento was \emph{the} most loyal Clan. From what she understood, if there was anyone the Sakr\'{a} needed to worry about it was the Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng Clan. Not to mention her father also seemed to think their thrust for power was something to watch. Dangerous. But she said none of that. Letting Akihiko ramble on about the Gento Clan.

``The offerings should start soon,'' she commented as he finished with his meal.

He nodded, before pointing to her plate. ``Not hunger?''

``No sorry,'' she replied with a smile, sincere only in it's pretense.

Not seeing anything wrong with her comment, Akihiko waved down the waiter. Aeliana raised an eyebrow as the manager hurried over. Taking their plates, he smiled giving several short bows in the process. ``I hope the food was too your liking.'' He spoke to her, but Akihiko answered.

``Yes, delicious as always, Uncle.'' Akihiko replied holding out his hand for the check, the manager looked strained as his eyes skipped between them.

\emph{`Now, what will you do? Insult the Helian family, or appease the Akihiko?'} Aeliana thought as she gave an open smile to the fidgeting man.

``No, no.'' He finally said waving away Akihiko's hand. ``This meal is on us.''

\emph{`Expertly done.'} Aeliana thought as she rose. ``Thank you for the meal.''

``Yes, thank you Uncle.'' Akihiko rose quickly to follow her.

``Yes, and do tell your parents about us, Cadet Helian. We've a shop in the Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng Sector just off of the main road.'' He called out, Aeliana pretended not to hear him as Akihiko jogged after her.

``Hey,'' he smiled down at her as he caught up. ``I'd offer you a seat in the Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng section, but the Commander's Halo is still out.''

Aeliana nodded, ``That's fine. My father arranged for a few viewing spots for the Guild.'' She responded. Before she could say more, movement to her right catch her attention. \emph{`Is that Haruto?'} The hair was brown, and the eyes all wrong, but general features were all the same.

``Is everything alright?'' Akihiko moved into her field of vision. When she looked again, the figure that might have been Haruto was gone.

``Yes, just thought I saw someone I knew.'' Aeliana replied. Turning to go to the center viewing, she wasn't took surprised to find Akihiko trailing her despite not begin invited.

``Anyway,'' he started beside her. ``This year, I'm sure we're going to have the best offering. Mother ellised 25\% more donations from the Clan this year than last year. So father was able to commission an artist from the Empire.'' He looked over at her as if that was something special. 

\emph{`I bet he doesn't even know that Empire artist range in skill.'} She thought. Her own family having purchased more than twenty of the Empire's finest for the event in the Jade Capital.

``Father's even hosting a Special Envoy this year.'' He continued in pride. ``That's why my seats taken.''

She nodded in feigned understanding. As she made her way toward the center of Solas. \emph{`Where did Erik say this thing was again?'} She thought.

\emph{Buzz.}

\textbf{\textsc{Ya lost again, kid?}} - Big brother Erik

Aeliana rolled her eyes in response. ``Excuse me for a second.'' Akihiko nodded as she stepped to the side before hitting call, she spoke, ``Just send me the address.''

``What? No, how's it goin'{}. No, it's great to see ya? Been missin'{} my big brother Erik?'' He responded.

``Don't even start.'' She replied.

``Oh, is ya time with ol stick in the mud not up to snuff?'' He replied amusement in his voice.

``Erik...'' She warned.

``Alright, alright. Sending. But next time, it's a search party.'' He answered followed by a buzz of her BISM. Looking at the directions, she motioned for Akihiko to follow.

``Thanks.'' She replied before ending the call.

With the direction, she was in front of a restaurant that must have been rented out for the Guild event. Akihiko looked down his nose at the young messengers running around. Aeliana's eyes, however, were on the lookout for Erik. If there was anyone who could get rid of her tail, it would be him.

``Aeliana, Aeliana!'' A group of young messengers came barreling into her. ``Look at all this candy!''

Kneeling down she gave a real smile, ``Wow, I'm so jealous.'' She spoke good-naturally.

``Here,'' each youth pushed a piece toward her. 

``We can get more.'' Another answered, this one missing his two front teeth.

``Well than, thank you.'' She replied taking only a single piece, before shooing them away. ``Go enjoy the party.''

They giggled as they ran off, probably to get more candy.

``I didn't know, the Guild took in orphans?'' Akihiko replied frown in his eyes was telling. ``They don't look like Kanopos children.''

``There not.'' Aeliana replied shortly.

``Oh, it's starting!'' Someone yelled out as if the Goddess was finally smiled down on her.

Moving toward the big Halo screen, she stood in the crowd as they watched the offerings begin. The third tier clans would be first. Even the Sakr\'{a} had to follow that rule.

``I of the Y\'{i}n Clan this silver statue for the great Y\`{u} Hu\'{a}ng Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i}.'' The statue was no bigger than ten centimeters in length. A modest gift for a Clan fallen on hard times.

Akihiko snorted next to her, ``Now, I'm sure they've gone bankrupt.''

``I of the H\'{u}si\={a}n Clan off this cherry tree. May it's roots grow strong for the great Y\`{u} Hu\'{a}ng Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i}.''

``Like they don't give a cherry tree every year.'' Akihiko snorted in complaint. Aeliana held her tongue.

The Sakr\'{a} stepped forward next, out of order causing the room to erupted into whispers. ``I, as the Sakr\'{a} offer this jade sword on behalf of the \={A}sh\u{i}n\`{a} Clan. A symbol of the beauty of battle.''

\emph{`That's strange.'} Aeliana thought sure that the Clan still had at least one member.

Akihiko leaned into her, ``Pilot \={A}sh\u{i}n\`{a} D\`{a}oc\u{a}or\'{e}n is teaching at OCI now.'' He whispered. ``It's why my brother was promoted.''

\emph{`What do you know, an Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng can be useful.'} She thought. Outwardly she nodded in thanks.

Stepping back, the Sakr\'{a} son took his father's position. ``I of the Wukong Clan give this jade gourd to the great Y\`{u} Hu\'{a}ng Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i}. May every sip he take from it bring him long life.''

For once, Akihiko had nothing to say to the young Wukong Clan member. Aeliana didn't question it. The third tier Clans bowed together before taking a step back to let the next four second tier Clans approach, Ilia among them.

Aeliana's eyes followed her ex-friend, even as the other three Clans presented their gifts. Everything else was lost in the background as Ilia stood tall next to her father. Just two years ago, the pair would have been exchanging looks while Ilia waited to go through this rehearsed gift exchange. If anyone had told Aeliana that she'd never stand behind the stage again, she'd have never believed them.  But now...

``Figured the Gongsaeng could afford something better after the way Seo-Jun talked about their gift.'' Akihiko complained next to her.

In that moment, she'd have given anything to turn back time.

Kur-ram followed his father back in a practiced bow as the two first tier Clans took their place. Akihiko's father and brother standing tall in representation of the Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng Clan.

``...May the Y\`{u} Hu\'{a}ng Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i} eat well with each bite.'' Kenta spoke next to his father bowing low hesitantly.

``Here we go,'' Akihiko said as he father moved to speak.

The camera zoomed out as a large covered statue was wheeled out. ``I of the Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng Clan off the esteemed Y\`{u} Hu\'{a}ng Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i}, this offering of a jade statue in his likeness.''

Pulling the cover off, revealed a three meter statue of gold and pale jade more white than green. Even from here, Aeliana could see the quality was rather poor. The transparency was completely opaque, and she could see red in some of the pieces. \emph{`But from Akihiko's admiring tone, you'd think it was made of solid imperial jade.'} She thought with a little humor. Aloud she said, ``Very impressive.''

The first tier Clans bowed before stepping back. Here, the Sakr\'{a} stepped again as he had for as long as she could remember this Festival. ``I have the pleasure of the Fujimi Noble Clan as well this fine Festival of Jade.'' He replied with a smile. ``To this end, they have offered a priceless work of art.'' A historian held up the scroll gentle.

``Is that made of paper?'' Aeliana caught herself saying aloud.

Akihiko said nothing beside her, but the crowded Guild member room made up with it as they all gasped in awe.

``That beats the coveralls off them Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng.'' Someone said in the crowd causing Aeliana to hold back a smile.

The Sakr\'{a} had a smile on his face before bowing, and stepping aside for Gento Yozora and the K\={o}taishi. ``Thank you, Hwasan for performing this blessed offering on the Fujimi Clan's behalf. We are all honored and humbled to have you as our Sakr\'{a}.'' Yozora spoke surprisingly sincerely.

``And to you, Yozora.'' The Sakr\'{a} nodded to him.

Yozora looked down at his heir as she took a step forward, bowing deep and low to the symbolic Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i} metal statue that was in place for this Festival. ``We of the Gento Clan offer the great and honorable Y\`{u} Hu\'{a}ng Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i} what is dearest to us.'' She bowed again as several elaborately dressed Gento carried a secured container up to her platform. 

\emph{`Is that even coveralls?'} She thought absentmindedly tugging on her own coveralls at the amount of fabric draped over the Gentos. They bowed first to the Sh\`{a}ngd\`{i} statue before bowing next to the K\={o}taishi and her father. If possible an even more elaborately dressed woman with a painted face and beads of jade around her neck stepped on to the stage. Both the K\={o}taishi and Yozora bowed to her as she bowed to them.

``Oh, great. Now their going to sing.'' Akihiko grumbled under his breath.

Aeliana was surprised when the woman on stage did begin to sign softly. Her voice going up and down in a pattern that reminded Aeliana of the Moon Festival parade. After a few minutes, she finished bowing again to the K\={o}taishi and her father before turning to the container.

``Ahh!'' She cried out causing the container to open on its own. Revealing a statue a meter high of pure imperial jade of the most striking woman Aeliana had ever seen.

``The Goddess.'' Aeliana whispered into the rumblings of the Guild. All in awe at the gift.

``May our Goddess be your.'' The K\={o}taishi finished with a bow as the intricately dressed Gento left the stage.

The Sakr\'{a} stepped forward nodding approvingly. ``Yes, I'm sure she will.'' Turning to the camera he smiled warmly. ``Now, without further adieu, shall we welcome the Honorable High Commander of the Keepers?''

Clapping sounded from the Halo screen. From experience, she knew that nearly the whole Keeper organization would be in the Clan's section just outside of the stage. One reason, she knew, that the Clans had so few seats near the stage.

``Yonaka?'' The Sakr\'{a} gestured for the Keepers'{} High Commander to speak.

``Thank you, Honorable Sakr\'{a}.'' He began. ``First, I'd like to welcome the Captains and their Command Captain.'' He said giving time for the fourteen stiffly dressed Keepers to move on stage. ``This year we are honored...''

``What the?'' Someone yelled out at the sight before them. The High Commander all black body armor, glowed bright orange. The color flickering across his body briefly before fading into a black-hole, Haruto's hacker signature.

``H\={e}id\'{o}ng?'' Someone else questioned in the crowd.

\emph{`Haruto, what have you done?'} She thought as she watched in morbid fascination at the angry orange contrasted against Yonaka's black body armor. A second later, and the whole thing burst into color, becoming a brilliant vibrant red the same color of Haruto's hair.

But of course Haruto's prank didn't end there. No, the whole stage of Keepers body armor had changed to various shades of red. \emph{`And I'm sure it doesn't end with the Captains either.'} She thought imaging patrol men and women with red body armor. Aeliana didn't know how he did it, and honestly didn't care.

As if on cue, what Aeliana was beginning to realize was SB3-QB9's laughter grumbled through the Halo screen.

A snort went off in the crowd, followed by another before the whole room was laughing with the somewhat demonic voice. Aeliana held back a smile herself. As long as nothing else happened, this was pretty harmless compared to his more elaborate pranks. But no sooner did the thought cross her mind, did the sound of fireworks going off.

\emph{Bang, bang, bang!}

Someone called from outside, ``Hey it's the Keeper Towers. Like all of them!''

Aeliana got pulled into the crowd as they rushed outside to see it the display. And sure enough, all the Keepers Towers expect for Tower One were bright red.  And fireworks surrounded them. The loud burst of colors and dazzling images dancing within the Solas in an absolutely spectacular fashion. \emph{`And using up using up countless amounts of oxygen.'} She thought as the brilliance of the display that could have been an Zh\`{u}r\'{o}ng performed feature for its execution. 

``Haruto.'' She sighed to herself. As the Solas sky filled with a large black-hole. Followed closely the phrase, 'We love H\={e}id\`{o}ng'{}. The boy didn't know how to be subtle.

Aeliana looked up at the artificial sky of Solas as the fireworks died down. The Guild party had clearly moved outside as children, teens, and adults alike danced in the streets excited by Haruto's display. In the distance, large red Towers stood proudly all over Kanopos.

``H\={e}id\`{o}ng!'' Was yelled from the Halo screens as movement hit the streets. Aeliana took a step back as someone nearly ran her over. Strong hands caught her before she could fall.

Looking up, she was surprised to see Erik by her side, ``I think we might wanna get outta here, yeah?''

She nodded as they headed out the back. The Keepers would have a hard time getting everyone under control after this. Which was going to be the least of their concerns, as no sooner had they stepped into the back alley did the whole ship go dark.

``Star dust!'' Someone cursed, and Aeliana wasn't sure if it was her or Erik.
